# tasktracker

TaskTracker is a To Do List app with a simple front end UI that allows users the ability to register, login, and access their own tasks.

Once logged in, users have the ability to view their task list, create new tasks, update tasks, complete tasks, and delete tasks. 

I used Django and implemented class based views which I learned are essentially just Django views written as Python classes. This allowed me the ability to use built in methods as well as separate my code by http method types such as GET and POST.
